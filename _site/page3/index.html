<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In my opinion the best way to learn a language is to develop applications in it once you are comfortable with the syntax.<br />It is a great learning process and teaches much more than what reading a book will teach you. Development is itself a very vast process, let me detail &nbsp;a very specific part of development. Web Based Application Development<br />Since it is a web based application, obviously you will have two parts, client side and server side.<br /><b>For Client Side Applications: </b>You can start with development of Chrome Extensions or Firefox Extensions. Alternatively, you can develop some Facebook or twitter Application. It will give you a great exposure to REST, plus you will get to work in the latest technologies as well.<br /><b>For Server Side Applications:</b><br />Try and develop an restful API system, such as some API for a facebook Application where the Server crunches your data and you have some meaningful information in your application. It might sound easy but its actually a quite tough thing to accomplish. Still it is a great learning experience. You might want to refer some good books in this process.<br /><br />Well, the point is you might not become a star developer of a sudden, but it will be one of the most rewarding experience in your software development process. Learning by doing, rather learning by failing in a very good process.<br /><br />So take a crazy idea and Start hacking!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3ePArKjFU2A/USzG-_LkJ5I/AAAAAAAABB0/4hGtwnLsTzQ/s1600/kung_fu_master_shifu_1920x1080.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3ePArKjFU2A/USzG-_LkJ5I/AAAAAAAABB0/4hGtwnLsTzQ/s400/kung_fu_master_shifu_1920x1080.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Â± May The Force Be With You!&nbsp;</div></div>

It is a free download from App Store.</li><li>Install Homebrew: This is a must and it is really satisfies the need to package manager in OSX.</li><li>Install dotfiles: Please use dotfiles, there are many good ones already shared on Github. You can use any one of them from here. <a href="http://dotfiles.github.com/" target="_blank">Install Dotfiles</a></li><li>Install z, oh-my-zsh: Oh my zsh is one of the best and feature rich shell, do use it with combination of z. Z is a directory jumping tool and it is really handy. <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z" target="_blank">Install Z</a></li><li>Install and configure a text editor: Install Sublime Text2, Vim or Emacs as your text editor. They are most extensible and powerful editors and you can configure them to satisfy all your needs. Make sure you invest sometime configuring it to your taste and needs. It will be intensely productive and satisfying experience.</li><li>Install Node and NPM: If you are web developer , you must have dealt with JavaScript. You must install both of them. Not only it extends the package manager needs, it is basis of other good package managers for web.</li><li>Install Component, Yeoman, Bower and Grunt. These are some&nbsp;indispensable&nbsp;tools that are very important for any web /&nbsp;web app&nbsp;developer.</li><li>Install Chrome Canary: If you want to get the best Developer tools available , install chrome canary. It is the latest and provide great support for various things such as sass, compass etc inbuilt.</li><li>Install Google drive and dropbox: Please keep your important stuff in cloud so that you may never loose your data again. Also, you can backup your code in Github.</li><li>Install SizeUP: It is one of most productive software on mac and provides such great arrangement of Windows that you will be amazed. Either buy it or install the trial version.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Install Sizeup</a></li><li>Install Git and create a account on Github, if you haven't already. There is such a vibrant community on Github, mostly great web developers that if you are not updated with it.You will loose great deal of useful information.</li><li>Automate most of the grunt jobs you do daily. Use build tools such as Make, Cake, Jake etc. Also, learn little bit of shell scripting. It really helps in long run.</li><li>Install Python and the module install tools such a pip and easy_install. It is really a must.</li><li>Install Ruby and ROR. They have pretty good community. Just a basis google search will get you going about the install and use process.</li><li>Install VirtualBox, it is an invaluable thing if you have to use another OS such as Windows or Ubuntu.</li></ul><div>I guess these are pretty exhaustive list of TODOS if you using mac for web/web-app development. I will keep updating the post if i remember any more important thing. The baseline is that macs are great piece of hardware and a pretty decent OS, so invest sometime in setting it up. It will save you tons of time and frustation. Have a good weekend, Enjoy!</div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I recently started using Sublime Text2 full time at work after being a vim user for more than 4 years. Vim is really good but it takes sometime to configure it properly. Well this is not a Vim vs ST2 debate. It is more of a vim user shifting to ST2 Tip.<br /><br />The first thing that you should do is to install package control, it provide really good 3rd party plugins. You can check out the link how to install it.&nbsp;<a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation" target="_blank">Install Package Control</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VyTJ6GhccRQ/USn4XUWXanI/AAAAAAAABBU/JM261l4WaZw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-24+at+4.52.12+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VyTJ6GhccRQ/USn4XUWXanI/AAAAAAAABBU/JM261l4WaZw/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-02-24+at+4.52.12+PM.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Once done with that open package manager and install these useful plugins<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>JSHint.</li><li>JSLint.</li><li>DocBlockr.</li><li>AngularJS.</li><li>Mocha &amp; Mocha snippet&nbsp;</li><li>NodeJS.</li><li>Live Reload.</li><li>AMD Module Editor</li><li>Backbone.js</li><li>Pretty JSON</li><li>Require Node.js Module Helper</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Among, these plugins mocha is the test runner and mocha snippets provides you will snippets to write the tests very fast. Also, there is good plugin for vim mode in Sublime Text2, you can use that if you don't want to waste the muscle memory.&nbsp;I highly recommend the real time linting with JSHint. It will make you so much more&nbsp;productive and improve your code as well. It acts as the first unit test against the code you just wrote.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>One more important thing, you could set the indentation with tab width equals to 2 spaces. It is a very sane default while writing JavaScript code.</div><div><br /></div><div>What really struck me was that Sublime Text enabled me to do almost everything i did with Vim without going into the pain of configuration. Also, the learning curve is not at all steep so i could get productive real fast.</div></div></div>

Which mocha plugin are you referring to, the runner? or the snippet package? I&#39;m assuming you mean the runner, but I wasn&#39;t sure at first...and in the interest of clarity for others who may also have this question, perhaps you could clarify?  My experience with the rest of the plugins was smooth, however.</div>

Here i will be writing it in form of a blog post.<br /><br />There are tons of JS Libraries, since JavaScript is one of hottest&nbsp;languages and a lot of developers work on it to develop rich client side as well as server side (NodeJS based) . So if your looking forward to use a MVC framework <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/" target="_blank">TodoMVC</a>&nbsp;is a great place to start with. Next for more&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;ones, you can check <a href="http://jster.net/">http://jster.net</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://devrates.com/project/list?query=%5Bjavascript%5D" target="_blank">devrates.com</a>.<br />Here are some good&nbsp;frameworks one should be familiar with such as AngularJS,&nbsp;BackBone JS, Mocha,&nbsp;Prototype JS.<br /><br />Well, the key is get familiar with JavaScript, and learn/use these libraries that interests you most. Also going through the source code of these libraries is a very enlightening experience.<br /><br />With that said, May the force be with you!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Starting with Front-End Development and looking for a robust setup?<br /><br />Install Ubuntu 12.04 and&nbsp;here are some of the tools and tips that could come handy if you are configuring it for the first time. I am not detailing on how to install these tools but rather would suggest on what could be good setup for&nbsp;development..<br /><b><br /></b><b>IDE</b>: This is where you spend most of the time. So choose wisely among Sublime Text2, Vim or Emacs. Vim and Emacs are entirely customizable and comes with loads of plugin that would really improve your&nbsp;efficiency. Sublime text is an awesome code editor and you must try it first as it is highly effective and has a lower learning curve. Also there are loads of good plugins available that makes it a handy tool.<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><b>Servers</b>: Install&nbsp;Apache 2,&nbsp;nginx and Node. This would cover most of the modern web server stack. Though node is technically not a server. But I hope you get my point.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Once Node and npm are installed there are some indispensable packages you must use. <b><i>UglifyJS </i></b>among others is a pretty handy one.&nbsp;Install<b><i> Compass </i></b>and <b><i>CoffeeScript</i></b>, also setup up <b><i>jslint/jshint</i></b> with your IDE. It will ensure a habit of shipping out quality code.<br /><br /><b>Browser<i>: Use the latest and nightly builds of Chromium/&nbsp;Firefox</i></b>, you should work with latest once so not miss any good feature/ improvements.</div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Install the <i style="font-weight: bold;">latest production release of Ruby, Python and Java, PHP </i>or whatever is your choice of language.&nbsp;</li><li>Learn<b><i> Version control </i></b>such as <b>git</b> and invest some time to learn it. It would save you tonnes of time later.</li><li>Last but not the least use<a href="http://www.blogger.com/%C2%A0http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">&nbsp;yeoman</a>&nbsp;. It is really gem of a tool, it , it gives a robust set of tools , libraries and a workflow that most of top developers use. Invest sometime in learning and using it and you will be always glad that you did.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Installing each one them on Ubuntu 12.04 is easy and obviously it is free and freakishly stable. Configure once and worry about the important aspects of&nbsp;development.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div></div>
